Light system:
* (X,Y) BFS propogation using radius from static light sources to achieve arbicular light
* Ray tracing delta pie for directed light to achieve dynamic far-light objects i.e. flashlights, glowing movable objects
* Particle light aura for fast dynamical objects, just overlapping lightmask with light sprite
