General concept:
The player spawns on planet Earth and begins to develop his own base.
He is going to face different monsters across the map and upgrade technology tree.
As soon as he evolve enough to leave the planet, other planets will be accessible trough navigation panel in the Solar system.
Each planet should keep it's own bunch of resources that is required for progress in specific branch of technology tree.

Features:
* The player has a unique login(nickname), recovery-email and password on each server he plays. It could be saved locally.
* It is possible to host server by starting dedicated server right from console or from launching it via in-game gui.
* Next player mods are available: survival, creative, debug
* Host player could make anyone to be in creative mod, which gives him invulnerability and unlimited access to resources.
* Host player could make anyone to be in debug mod, which gives him full access to game features for easier debugging
* It is possible to zoom in some range depending on the player's mod
* Player can claim some number of chunks (square area) into his base and configure access for other players to protect his property.
* Dynamic objects that can be thrown/dropped, be a part of static environment, some objects have despawn time and some is not, some can be destroyed
* Effects (short animations) can be spawned in huge amounts and can cause glowing, depending
* Chunks - square area of blocks can be loaded dyna
* Average visible map size 200x150 blocks and map size 4000 x 3000
* Suggestion to render patches of blocks over chunks and to dynamically load/unload them based on visibility area
* Items can be thrown, used, destroyed, crafted, placed as static-entity in the world
* One static-entity can occupy multiple blocks and player can destroy that entity from any side and any part
